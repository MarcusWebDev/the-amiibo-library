# The Amiibo Library

This is the front end for The Amiibo Library website found at amiibolibrary.com.

## How to use

### Homepage

On the homepage in the top carousel you can see the 10 most recently released amiibos. Below that you can find the 10 most collected and 10 least collected amiibos. Clicking on any of these amiibos will take you to a page with more details about the amiibo. This is true of all amiibo cards on the website.

### Amiibo Page

This page lists all amiibo that are available through amiiboapi.com. You can use the tools at the top of the page, or in the hamburger menu if you are on mobile, to filter and sort the amiibos.

### My Collection Page

This page shows all amiibo by default, with amiibo you have collected being fully colored and amiibo you have not collected being grayscale. Similarly to the amiibo page, you can filter and sort the amiibo here using the tools at the top of the page, or in the hamburger menu if you are on mobile. If you would like to change the collected status of an amiibo or several amiibos, you can click on the `Add / Remove` button. Clicking this button will enable a mode that will allow you to mark uncollected amiibo as collected, and collected amiibo as uncollected. After you have selected amiibo that you would like to change the collected status of, you can click on `Confirm Changes` to save these changes to the database.

### Amiibo Details Page

Upon clicking on an amiibo card, you will be navigated to the amiibo details page. This page will provide you details about the amiibo, including its original game series, when it was released in different countries, and the amiibo's usage across several different video game consoles. This page also includes a button that will allow you to add the amiibo to or remove the amiibo from your collection.
